# Execution

## Dasboard and command line

The system should execute continuously, and be accessible via the web interface or via the command line (ssh).

To access the dashboard, open a web browser and navigate to the IP address of your Edgebox system or to [http://edgebox.local] when the server is in your local network.

The first time you open the dasboard, you will be asked to introduce a username and password, that will be used to secure access.

## Edgeapps

Edgeapps are the applications that run on the Edgebox system.

These are the applications that provide the functionality that you would normally get from cloud services. They can be easily installed, uninstalled, updated and configured.

When choose to install an edgeapp via the dashboard or cli, it will be automatically configured to run on the system. You can see which edgeapps you have installed, and access them, via the web interface, or their dedicated subdomains.
