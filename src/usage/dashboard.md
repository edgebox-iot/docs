The system should execute continuously, and be accessible via the web interface either in the local network or via the internet.

## üîó Accessing the dashboard

To access the dashboard, open a web browser and navigate to [http://edgebox.local](http://edgebox.local) when the server is in your local network. If you previously configured a custom domain, you can also use that domain to access the dashboard, even when not in the local network. Check the [external access](/configuration/external-access) page for more information.

!!! info

    If you are using the Cloud version of Edgebox, you can access the dashboard at `https://<username>.edgebox.io` (replace `<username>` with your username)

The first time you open the dasboard, you will be asked to introduce a username and password, that will be used to secure access.
