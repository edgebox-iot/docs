# ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

**The settings page allows you to change options that affect the dashboard behavior, or the whole system.** It is divided in the following sections:

- **Dashboard Behavior**: These settings affect the dashboard behavior such as visual properties and other access settings.
- **External Access**: These settings affect the external access to the dashboard, such as the custom domain configuration or the web shell session access.

Once a session is started, you can close it or open it via the "_**Open Shell**" button.
