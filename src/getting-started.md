# Getting Started

## Self-hosting

Edgebox can run on a variety of hardware, from a Raspberry Pi to a full-blown server. The only requirement is that it has a Linux operating system that supports `systemctl` installed.

To get started, check out the [installation guide](setup/installation.md).

## Software as a Service

Edgebox will also be available as a cloud service with 1-click signup. You will be able to sign up for a free account at [https://edgebox.io](https://edgebox.io) once we make it available.
