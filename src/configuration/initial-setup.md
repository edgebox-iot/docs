# ⚙️ Initial Setup

## 🔐 Locking the dashboard

The first time you open the dashboard, you will be asked to introduce a username and password, that will be used to secure access.

This is all the basic setup you need to do to get started. You can now start exploring the dashboard and get familiar with it. You can check the [dashboard](/usage/dashboard) page for more information.

## 🚶 Next Steps

Here's some recommended things you can do with a fresh install:

- [Install and access an EdgeApp](/usage/edgeapps/#installing-an-edgeapp)
- [Configure external access with a custom domain](/configuration/external-access)
- [Configure backups](/configuration/backups)
- [Check and change the dashboard settings](/usage/settings)
