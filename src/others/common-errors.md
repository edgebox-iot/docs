    If you are trying to connect to your edgebox using SSH and you get a warning, it is likely that the you had a previous box with the same name and the SSH key has changed. To fix this, you can delete the old key from your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -R edgebox.local
    ```

    If you try connecting again, the issue should now be clear.
