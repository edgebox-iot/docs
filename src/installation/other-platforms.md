# 😶‍🌫️ Installing Edgebox on other platforms

We have a simple to use installer that will build ready to use images of Edgebox for various environments, including DigitalOcean.
To use it, go to the [edgebox-iot/image-builder](https://github.com/edgebox-iot/image-builder) repository and follow the instructions there.

!!! warning "This installer is out-of-date"
    We will be updating and adding more platforms in the future. The current installer is unstable and not ready for daily usage. If you want to contribute, please read the [contributing guide](/contributing) and get in touch with us.
