# Edgebox Docs

Edgebox provides an independent, open-source system to run your own cloud applications. These cloud alternatives allow you to unplug yourself from nasty monthly subscriptions, limited data caps, compression, and loss of original data.

A very simple to use interface allows you to do the initial setup, authenticate yourself and control various functions of the system, be it toggling features, managing "edgeapps", or accessing them!

This documentation site starts from the beginning and dwelves deeply into all subject composing the product. Once you find a specific module you want to look in more detail, you'll be linked to the specific repository where further technical information for that module can be found.

We use public GitHub repositories to develop our work, and try to separate the code into purposeful parts that can be individually developed.

Our GitHub organization can be seen at https://github.com/edgebox-iot.

Because our code is open-source, we will always document the entirity of our processes and internals as best as we can, but we understand not everybody wants to know **everything**, and we want to make everyone's life easier. Thus, we decided to separate the documentation into two different areas: "For Users" and "For Tinkers". One for the more basic, non-advanced, usage-prespective documentation. The other with all the neaty greaty of how things work, up to the source code.
