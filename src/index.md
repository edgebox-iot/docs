# Edgebox Docs

Edgebox provides an independent, open-source system to run your own cloud applications. These cloud alternatives allow you to unplug yourself from nasty monthly subscriptions, limited data caps, compression, and loss of original data.

A very simple to use interface allows you to do the initial setup, authenticate yourself and control various functions of the system, be it toggling features, managing "edgeapps", or accessing them.

This documentation site starts from the beginning and dwelves deeply into all subject composing the product. Once you find a specific module you want to look in more detail, you'll be linked to the specific repository where further technical information for that module can be found.

We use public GitHub repositories to develop our work, and try to separate the code into purposeful parts that can be individually developed.

Our GitHub organization can be seen at [https://github.com/edgebox-iot](https://github.com/edgebox-iot).

Because this is an open-source project, we will always document the entirity of our processes and internals as best as we can, but we understand not everybody wants to know **everything**, and we want to make everyone's life easier. Thus, we decided to have this documentation site targeting an audience of non-experienced users. Developers and tinkerers should be able to find their way around the codebase and the documentation included with that same codebase.
