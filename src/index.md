# Edgebox Docs

## What is Edgebox?

Edgebox provides an independent, open-source system to run your own cloud applications, and keep your data safe. These cloud alternatives allow you to unplug yourself from nasty monthly subscriptions, limited data caps, compression, and loss of original data.

What differs Edgebox from other similar projects is that it is being designed as a simple yet powerful and stable way to self-host without technical knowledge. Accessing your Edgebox system is as simple as opening a web browser and navigating to the url of your Edgebox system.

## How does it work?

A simple to use dashboard allows you to do the initial setup, authenticate yourself and control various functions of the system, be it toggling features, managing "edgeapps", or accessing them.

Edgeapps are the applications that run on the Edgebox system. They are one of the highlight features. They are the applications that provide the functionality that you would normally get from cloud services. They can be easily installed, uninstalled, updated and configured.

This documentation site starts from the beginning goes through the setup, installation and configuration process. Once you find a specific module you want to look in more detail, you'll be linked to the specific repository where further technical information for that module can be found.

We use public GitHub repositories to develop our work, and try to separate the code into purposeful parts that can be individually developed.

Our GitHub organization can be seen at [https://github.com/edgebox-iot](https://github.com/edgebox-iot).

Because this is an open-source project, we will always document the entirity of our processes and internals as best as we can, but we understand not everybody wants to know **everything**, and we want to make everyone's life easier. Thus, we decided to have this documentation site targeting an audience of non-experienced users. Developers and tinkerers should be able to find their way around the codebase and the documentation included with that same codebase.
