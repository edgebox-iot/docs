All changes, small or big, are welcome, and regardless of who you are, we are always happy to work together to make your contribution as strong as possible. We follow the [Covenant Code of Conduct](/others/code-of-conduct), so we ask you to uphold it. Be kind to everyone in the community, and please report unacceptable behavior to info@edgebox.io

## Questions, Feature Requests, and Discussions

Post any questions, feature requests, or discussions in the respective discussion board of the repositories they should be part of.

## Bug Reports

Report any bugs in the respective code repository, keeping in mind to:

- Debug and simplify the problem to create a minimal example. For example, reduce the problem to a single participant, sensor, and a few rows of data.
- Provide a clear and succinct description of the problem (expected behavior vs. actual behavior).
- Attach any logs you get from the console or the log file.
- Attach test data if possible and any screenshots or extra resources that will help us debug the problem.
- Share the commit you are running: `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
- Share your OS version (e.g., Debian 10, Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10)
- Share the edgeapp/system functionality you are using (e.g., backups, edgeapps, etc.)

If you are not sure where to report the bug, please post it in our mail (info@edgebox.io) and we will help you find the right place.
