These cloud alternatives allow you to unplug yourself from nasty monthly subscriptions, limited data caps, compression, and loss of original data.</p> <p></p> <p>What differs Edgebox from other similar projects is that it is being designed as a simple yet powerful and stable way to run your private cloud apps, without technical knowledge. Accessing your Edgebox system is as simple as opening a browser and navigating to a website, but it extends and allows you to access a variety of applications and services that you would normally get from cloud providers, together with solid client apps for your devices, and easy-to-follow documentation on everything you need to know.</p>"},{"location":"#how-does-it-work","title":"\ud83c\udf91 How does it work?","text":"<ul> <li> Dashboard</li> <li> Storage</li> <li> Backups</li> <li> Edgeapps</li> </ul> <p>The Dashboard is the main entrypoint and allows you to control the various functions, be it toggling features, managing apps or backups, or checking the status of the system.</p> <p>A Storage page that gives you an overview of your attached storage. You can see how much space is available, and how much is being used. You can also manage your storage, and add new storage devices.</p> <p>A Backups page that allows you to keep track and further secure your data. You can configure a secure storage for your data, with proven secure options a couple ckicks away. See how many backups you have, and when they were created. With a freshly setup edgebox, you can also restore a backup made on a different machine.</p> <p>Edgeapps are the open applications that run on the Edgebox system.
