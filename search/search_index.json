These cloud alternatives allow you to unplug yourself from nasty monthly subscriptions, limited data caps, compression, and loss of original data.</p> <p></p> <p>What differs Edgebox from other similar projects is that it is being designed as a simple yet powerful and stable way to run your private cloud apps, without technical knowledge. Accessing your Edgebox system is as simple as opening a browser and navigating to a website, but it extends and allows you to access a variety of applications and services that you would normally get from cloud providers, together with solid client apps for your devices, and easy-to-follow documentation on everything you need to know.</p>"},{"location":"#how-does-it-work","title":"\ud83c\udf91 How does it work?","text":"<ul> <li> Dashboard</li> <li> Storage</li> <li> Backups</li> <li> Edgeapps</li> </ul> <p>The Dashboard is the main entrypoint and allows you to control the various functions, be it toggling features, managing apps or backups, or checking the status of the system.</p> <p>A Storage page that gives you an overview of your attached storage. You can see how much space is available, and how much is being used. You can also manage your storage, and add new storage devices.</p> <p>A Backups page that allows you to keep track and further secure your data. You can configure a secure storage for your data, with proven secure options a couple ckicks away. See how many backups you have, and when they were created. With a freshly setup edgebox, you can also restore a backup made on a different machine.</p> <p>Edgeapps are the open applications that run on the Edgebox system. They are one of the highlight features. They are the applications that provide the functionality that you would normally get from cloud services. They can be easily installed, uninstalled, updated and configured to your specific needs.</p> <p>Check the menu on the left for a full list of topics regarding installation, configuration, and usage of Edgebox. This page will address all the topics in a more general, user-oriented way.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>Because this is an open-source project, we will always document the entirity of our processes and internals as best as we can, but we understand not everybody wants to know everything, and we want to make everyone's life easier. Therefore, we decided to have this documentation site targeting an audience of non-experienced users. Developers and tinkerers should be able to find their way around the codebase and the documentation included with that same codebase.</p> <p>We use public GitHub repositories to develop our work, and try to separate the code into purposeful parts that can be individually developed, and where more technical / development oriented documentation can be found.</p> <p>GitHub Organization </p>"},{"location":"contributing/","title":"\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udd27 Contributing","text":"<p>Thank you for your interest in making a contribution! </p> <p>All changes, small or big, are welcome, and regardless of who you are, we are always happy to work together to make your contribution as strong as possible.
