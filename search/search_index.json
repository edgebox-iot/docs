The main components are:</p> <ul> <li><code>edgeboxctl</code>, which is the main system control service, running at the operating system level, and responsible for interfacing between the operating system and the edgebox system, providing features like running operations on a clock tick, docker container orchestration management (via <code>ws</code> or <code>directly</code>) and status reporting (parsing from various sources and sometiemes saving this information in the <code>api</code> db for dashboard display).</li> <li><code>api</code>, which currently is responsible for serving a database that manages the dashboard and status report storage created by <code>edgeboxctl</code>. It also hosts the main web dashboard where the user can manage some of the system features. <code>api</code> never interfaces directly with <code>edgeboxctl</code>, instead leaves \"tasks\" in its database that are picked up by the system service and executed accordingly.</li> <li><code>apps</code> are the applications that run on the Edgebox system. They are the container definitions that provide the services necessary to create the apps and give you the functionality that you would normally get from cloud services. Each application has its own folder and follows some conventions regarding configuration file definitions, binary file definitioons, and others. <code>ws</code> uses this information to create your containerized applications.</li> <li><code>ws</code> is the web services orchestration module. It is a service itself (a proxy pass) that is responsible for routing the requests to the correct applications installed in the system, but also a set of utilities that can read the <code>apps</code> folder for definitions, manage their state, and order <code>docker</code> to run them.</li> </ul> <pre><code>graph LR\n    E[edgeboxctl] --&gt; WS[ws];\n    WS --&gt; DOCKER;\n    E --&gt; DOCKER[Docker];\n    WS --&gt; APPS[Apps];\n    DOCKER --&gt; API[Api/Dashboard container];\n    E --&gt; APIV[Api/Dashboard container volume];\n    API --&gt; APIV;\n    DOCKER &lt;--&gt; PROXY[ws-proxy container];\n    DOCKER --&gt; EDGEAPP[edgeapp container];\n    PROXY &lt;--&gt; EDGEAPP;\n    EDGEAPP &lt;--&gt; EDGEAPPV[Edgeapp container volume];\n    PROXY &lt;--&gt; API;\n    PROXY &lt;--&gt; CF[CloudFlare Tunnel];\n    CF &lt;--&gt; EU[External User];\n    PROXY &lt;--&gt; NU[Network User];</code></pre>"},{"location":"others/code-of-conduct/","title":"Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct","text":""},{"location":"others/code-of-conduct/#our-pledge","title":"Our Pledge","text":"<p>We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p> <p>We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.</p>"},{"location":"others/code-of-conduct/#our-standards","title":"Our Standards","text":"<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:</p> <ul> <li>Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people</li> <li>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li> <li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li> <li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,   and learning from the experience</li> <li>Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the   overall community</li> </ul> <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior include:</p> <ul> <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or   advances of any kind</li> <li>Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li> <li>Public or private harassment</li> <li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email   address, without their explicit permission</li> <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a   professional setting</li> </ul>"},{"location":"others/code-of-conduct/#enforcement-responsibilities","title":"Enforcement Responsibilities","text":"<p>Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p> <p>Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.</p>"},{"location":"others/code-of-conduct/#scope","title":"Scope","text":"<p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
