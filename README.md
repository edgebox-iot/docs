Hi! Here you'll be able to find all documentation for the Edgebox project.

It starts from the beginning and dwelves deeply into all subject composing the product. Once you find a specific module you want to look in more detail, you'll be linked to the specific repository where further technical information for that module can be found.

We use public GitHub repositories to develop our work, and try to separate the code into purposeful parts that can be individually developed.

Our GitHub organization can be seen at https://github.com/edgebox-iot.

Because our code is open-source, we will always document the entirity of our processes and internals as best as we can, but we understand not everybody wants to know **everything**, and we want to make everyone's life easier. Thus, we decided to separate the documentation into two different areas: "For Users" and "For Tinkers". One for the more basic, non-advanced, usage-prespective documentation. The other with all the neaty greaty of how things work, up to the source code.

## Documentation topics "For Users"
